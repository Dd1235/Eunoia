# What good Todos look like

Creating effective todos is a mix of **clarity, psychology, and practicality**. A good todo list not only helps you remember what to do, but also motivates you to do it. Here’s how to do it **right**, with supporting psychology-based principles and resource suggestions.

### **Best Practices for Making Great Todos**

#### 1. **Make Each Todo an Actionable Task**

- **Good**: “Write outline for DBMS presentation”
- **Bad**: “DBMS presentation”
- _Why:_ Our brains respond better to clear **next actions** (David Allen, _Getting Things Done_ framework).

#### 2. **Use Specific and Measurable Language**

- “Solve 2 Leetcode easy problems on trees”
- “Do Leetcode”
- _Psych trick:_ Specific tasks reduce _decision fatigue_.

#### 3. **Break Down Large Goals into Small Steps**

- Large: “Finish Eunoia project”

  - Break into:

    1. “Fix bug in audio player UI”
    2. “Write POST endpoint for meditation upload”
    3. “Test dark mode for new chat UI”

- _Tip:_ Use 25-min Pomodoro-sized subtasks.

#### 4. **Add Context or Location if Helpful**

- Example: “Read 10 pages of ‘AI paper’ on iPad (during commute)”
- Helps associate tasks with **triggers** → better habit formation.

#### 5. **Prioritize & Limit Your List**

- Pick **3 most important tasks** per day (Ivy Lee method).
- Keep total daily todos ≤ 7 (cognitive limit for working memory).

#### 6. **Use a Consistent Structure**

Example structure:

```
[Type] Verb – Specific task – Context
e.g., [Code] Fix meditation POST route – backend/api
```

Or use [time blocking](https://calnewport.com/time-blocking/) to slot tasks into calendar chunks.

#### 7. **Include Motivating or Rewarding Tasks**

- “30-min workout + music”
- “Write journal with chai”
- Boosts dopamine for long-term consistency.

#### 8. **Review & Adjust Daily**

- In the morning: pick top 3.
- At night: short review + celebrate wins.
